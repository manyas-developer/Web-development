Country Finder is a simple and responsive web app that fetches real-time country data from the REST Countries API. Users can search for a country and view details such as flag, capital, population, region, languages, currencies, time zones, borders, and map links.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean UI and API integration.
